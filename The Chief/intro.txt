Long ago, before humans even existed, before any galaxy exists, Or the multiverse. There was three Dimentions. One was a beautuful dimension, The other the Dark Realm, A very corrupting force only explained by pure evil. And lastly The spiritual plane, which cannot be destroyed or entered unless a soul of a being is judged worthy, if not worthy they were sent to the dark dimensions.
now you some background.

Let me tell you how i fit in this.
The people of the light dimension thought they where alone, that is untill they were invaded by the dark dimension that i will now mension as "The Darkness". The light dimension had mastered a knowlege of there universe and starting dabbling in going to others they instantly created a bridge of wich they couldnt close as the armys of darkness fell across there dimension. The spirutual plane was heavily unbalenced.
As the war waged The light decided to call upon an elite 8 of the best soldiers they had ever seen.
They fought but they fell as a last stand to end it. for fear of the end of the other dimensions.  The last 3 resort to an an weapon that destroyed all stars and worlds at once oblitering the entire universe creating the multiverse as we know it.
nearing the end of there lives one of the soldiers had blow it the other 2 held them back but became corrupted. the last soldier became half corrupted before pushing the Button. So Who Am I? Im the last Soldier! I Am an Alpha Centerion, The Gaurdian of light and Dark, The Balencer. Am I Alone in this fight who knows. 
But my human name is Riley Johnsen. And the Darkness is still here.
